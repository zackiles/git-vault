# Important
Before using your tools to understand the codebase, start by reviewing the following known files:

- General Overview of Git-Vault: `<project-root>/test/README.md`
- Testing and Development documentation: `<project-root>/test/README.md`
  - Ensure when debugging tests you use [run-tests.sh](mdc:test/run-tests.sh) to be able to set a timeout as some tests in this suite can hang occasionally.
- Single File Snapshot of Codebase: Repomix is used to peridocially take a snapshot of the entire codebase into a single xml file that can be found at `<project-root>/.ai/context/codebase-context.xml`
  - It needs to be re-generated after large changes to the codebase by running the script in `<project-root>/.ai/build-context.sh`
- Release Workflows: `<project-root>/test/RELEASING.md`
