- This is a Deno 2 project
- Source files in `src/` and tests in `test/`
- Running development, Testing, Linting, Type-checking and other tasks are provided in Deno tasks in the file `deno.json`. Always use them instead of direct calls to the Deno CLI such as `deno test -A ...`
- Git commit messages are semantic commit
- Github actions automate building, testing, and releasing for: Github Release, Chocolatey, and Homebrew tap. Their Github Workflows are in `.github`
- Avoid repetitve code, refactor to hoist and share functions and variables that are used in multiple places
- User facing errors for code in `src/` MUST use the terminal.error message in the file `src/utils/terminal.ts`
- Prompts, spinners, and other interactive CLI elements MUST be provided by the file `src/utils/terminal.ts`
- Avoid hardcoding values such as paths in multiple places, instead use the file [constants.ts](mdc:src/constants.ts)

- Never leave obvious or redudant inline code comments
- Rarely use inline code comments
- Always use `deno task test` to run tests
- Always run tests after a large change to code files in  `src/` or `test/`
- This project can be tests and run on ALL platforms so you MUST ensure all code, such as paths, work on Windows Linux and MacOS
