# How To Use The Repomix File
**CRITICAL**: Review the shown or mentioned file with the name `codebase-summary.xml` before actioning the user's query.

## Notes on `codebase-summary.xml`
- **REPOMIX FILE LOCATION**: Stored in `<project-root>/.ai/context/codebase-summary.xml`
- **REPOMIX FILE CONTENTS**: Contains ALL code, documentation, and tests related to this project summarized into a single file.
- The file was created using Repomix
- The repomix configuration is at [repomix.config.json](mdc:repomix.config.json)
- The script that builds the Repomix file file is at [build-context.sh](mdc:.ai/build-context.sh)
- The file is manually generated by running the script [build-context.sh](mdc:.ai/build-context.sh) and may be out of date.
- **IMPORTANT**: Use the file `codebase-summary.xml` ONLY as a reference, always inspect the actual files in the codebase for a completely accurate picture of what is actually true. The xml file may be stale and out of date
- **NOTE**: Consider regenerating the xml file using [build-context.sh](mdc:.ai/build-context.sh)
