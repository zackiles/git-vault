# Follow After Fixing or Solving A Repeat Bug Or Issue
This project uses shell scrips cross platform which are brittle and can be difficult to implement. If you discover an interesting quirk, such as a hard to fix failing test, add your discovered quirk and the thing you learned to solve it so other engineers don't make the same mistake.
