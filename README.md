Drop-dead-simple tool for storing sensitive files or folders in git. Git hooks and GPG transparently encrypt and decrypt resources within your repository, keeping them encrypted remotely but available locally. Works on all **platforms**, **dummy-proof**, and **secure**!

## Why Git-Vault?

There's never been a quick, simple, consistent, and git-native way to secure files or folders securely within a repo. These options tend to suck:

* ***Private registry for resources?**:

* ðŸ‘Ž Effort, cost, and either everyone gets access or they don't (e.g NPM org).

* **Bespoke pipelines to fetch resources?**:

* ðŸ‘Ž Effort, cost, consistency, and way too big of a hammer for most situations.

* **Everything else?**:

* ðŸ‘Ž Native git hooks, cross-platform, 3rd party dependencies, complicated, sketchy code...The closest project to this one is [git-crypt]([git-crypt](https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt)) which is great, but takes a bit too much manual work and the project is no-longer actively maintained.

## Installation

Install Git-Vault as needed per-project by running the following command from the root of your Git repository:

```bash
curl -sSL https://github.com/zackiles/git-vault/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash
```

For Git repositories with large files, you can specify a custom threshold for Git LFS integration:

```bash
curl -sSL https://github.com/zackiles/git-vault/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash -s -- --min-lfs=10
```

This script performs the following setup:

*   Checks for and offers to install any missing dependencies (`gpg`, `tar`, `sha1sum`/`shasum`, `mktemp`, `sed`)
*   Copies the necessary scripts (`add.sh`, `remove.sh`, `encrypt.sh`, `decrypt.sh`) into a `.git-vault/` directory within your project.
*   Creates a `.git-vault/storage/` directory where encrypted files will eventually be stored.
*   Creates an empty `.git-vault/paths.list` file to track vaulted items, if it doesn't already exist.
*   Installs Git hooks (`pre-commit`, `post-checkout`, `post-merge`) into your repository's hooks directory (e.g., `.git/hooks/` or a custom path) to automate encryption and decryption.
*   Updates your root `.gitignore` file to ensure password files (`.git-vault/*.pw`) are not committed.
*   Configures Git LFS for large archives if Git LFS is available (see [Git LFS Integration](#git-lfs-integration) below).

> [!NOTE]
> Git-Vault has automatic dependency detection and installation. If any required dependencies are missing, the script will offer to install them automatically for you based on your operating system. Supported platforms include Linux (Debian/Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch), macOS, and Windows (Git Bash/MinGW).

## Usage

**Add a file/directory to the vault:**
  ```bash
  .git-vault/add.sh <path/to/your/secret>
  ```
  Follow the prompts to set a password. This will create an encrypted archive in `.git-vault/storage/`, add the path to `.git-vault/paths.list`, create a `.pw` file in `.git-vault/`, and update `.gitignore`.

**Remove a file/directory from the vault:**
  ```bash
  .git-vault/remove.sh <path/to/your/secret>
  ```
  This verifies the password, removes the archive and manifest entry, renames the `.pw` file, and optionally cleans up `.gitignore`.

**Commit Changes:** Remember to commit changes made by `add.sh` or `remove.sh` (like the encrypted archive in `.git-vault/storage/`, `.git-vault/paths.list`, and `.gitignore`).

## How It Works

*   **Encryption (`pre-commit` hook):** Before you commit, `.git-vault/encrypt.sh` automatically re-encrypts any tracked plaintext files listed in `paths.list` into their corresponding archives in `.git-vault/storage/`. Only the encrypted archive is staged.
*   **Decryption (`post-checkout`, `post-merge` hooks):** After checking out a branch or merging, `.git-vault/decrypt.sh` automatically decrypts the archives found in `.git-vault/storage/` back to their original plaintext locations, using the corresponding `.pw` files.

## Git LFS Integration

Git-Vault now integrates with Git LFS to efficiently manage large encrypted archives. When files larger than the threshold (default: 5MB) are added to git-vault, they are automatically tracked with Git LFS if available.

**Benefits:**

- Prevents repository bloat caused by large binary files
- More efficient handling of version history for large files
- Better performance for cloning and fetching repositories with large assets

**Requirements:**

- Git LFS must be installed on your system. [Install Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/)
- Your Git hosting provider must support Git LFS (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.)

**Configuration:**

- The default threshold for LFS tracking is 5MB
- You can customize this threshold during installation with `--min-lfs=<size>` where `<size>` is in megabytes
- The threshold is stored in `.git-vault/lfs-config` for reference by other scripts

**Behavior:**
- If Git LFS is not available, git-vault will still function but will store large files directly in Git
- When LFS is available, git-vault will automatically set up `.gitattributes` and configure LFS tracking
- Archives exceeding the size threshold will be tracked with LFS, while smaller ones will use regular Git tracking

## When To Use It

- Sharing sensitive build artifacts with maintainers or CI/CD pipelines
- AI-native codebases where sensitive information is used to provide context to agents working on the codebase
- Data and research-heavy repositories where tools and data are mixed and have varying access rights between contributors
- Inner-source projects, such as those found in finance, where contributors can often have certain things fire-walled from one another depending on their department
- Repositories with large binary files that need encryption (images, videos, datasets) where Git LFS integration provides efficient storage
- Because you're lazy and only want to type a single command and be done with it

## Development and Testing

This repository contains the **source code** for Git-Vault. The scripts reside at the root level here. When *installed* in your own repository using the command above, the scripts are placed inside the `.git-vault/` subdirectory of *your* project.

The project includes a comprehensive test suite using `bats-core`. Tests verify functionality for:

* Core operations (add, remove, encryption, decryption)
* Error handling and edge cases
* Git hook integration
* Git LFS integration for large archives
* Automatic dependency detection and installation
