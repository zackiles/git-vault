Drop-dead-simple tool for sharing sensitive files or folders. Git hooks and GPG transparently encrypt and decrypt resources within your repository, keeping them encrypted remotely but available locally. Works on all **platforms**, **dummy-proof**, and **secure**!

## Why Git-Vault?

There's never been a quick, simple, consistent, and git-native way to secure files or folders securely within a repo. These options tend to suck:

**Private registry for resources?**:
 ðŸ‘Ž Effort, cost, and either everyone gets access or they don't (e.g NPM org).

**Bespoke pipelines to fetch resources?**:
ðŸ‘Ž Effort, cost, consistency, and way too big of a hammer for most situations.

**Everything else?**:
ðŸ‘Ž Native git hooks, cross-platform, 3rd party dependencies, complicated, sketchy code...

## Installation

Run the following command from the root of your Git repository:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zackiles/git-vault/main/install.sh | bash
```

This will:

*   Create `git-vault/` and `storage/` directories in your project root.
*   Copy the necessary scripts (`add.sh`, `remove.sh`, `encrypt.sh`, `decrypt.sh`) into `./git-vault/`.
*   Create `./git-vault/paths.list` to track vaulted files.
*   Install hooks (`pre-commit`, `post-checkout`, `post-merge`) into `.git/hooks/`.
*   Update your root `.gitignore` to ignore `./git-vault/*.pw` password files.

**Important:** You need `gpg`, `tar`, `sha1sum` (or `shasum`), and `mktemp` installed and available in your PATH.

## Usage

*   **Add a file/directory to the vault:**
    ```bash
    git-vault/add.sh <path/to/your/secret>
    ```
    Follow the prompts to set a password. This will create an encrypted archive in `storage/`, add the path to `git-vault/paths.list`, create a `.pw` file in `git-vault/`, and update `.gitignore`.

*   **Remove a file/directory from the vault:**
    ```bash
    git-vault/remove.sh <path/to/your/secret>
    ```
    This verifies the password, removes the archive and manifest entry, renames the `.pw` file, and optionally cleans up `.gitignore`.

**Commit Changes:** Remember to commit changes made by `add.sh` or `remove.sh` (like the encrypted archive in `storage/`, `git-vault/paths.list`, and `.gitignore`).

## How It Works

*   **Encryption (`pre-commit` hook):** Before you commit, `./git-vault/encrypt.sh` automatically re-encrypts any tracked plaintext files listed in `paths.list` into their corresponding archives in `storage/`. Only the encrypted archive is staged.
*   **Decryption (`post-checkout`, `post-merge` hooks):** After checking out a branch or merging, `./git-vault/decrypt.sh` automatically decrypts the archives found in `storage/` back to their original plaintext locations, using the corresponding `.pw` files.

## When To Use It

- Sharing sensitive build artifacts with maintainers or CI/CD pipelines
- AI-native codebases where sensitive information is used to provide context to agents working on the codebase
- Data and research-heavy repositories where tools and data are mixed and have varying access rights between contributors
- Inner-source projects, such as those found in finance, where contributors can often have certain things fire-walled from one another depending on their department
- Because you're lazy and only want to type a single command and be done with it

## Development and Testing

This repository contains the **source code** for Git-Vault. The scripts reside at the root level here. When *installed* in your own repository using the command above, the scripts are placed inside the `git-vault/` subdirectory of *your* project.

The project includes a comprehensive test suite using `bats-core`. Tests verify functionality for:

- Core operations (add, remove, encryption, decryption)
- Error handling and edge cases
- Git hook integration

For details on running or modifying tests, see the [test/README.md](test/README.md) file.

## Development Environment Setup

To contribute to Git-Vault development, you need to set up your local environment. This ensures you can run the tests and work with the scripts.

**Compatibility:** Git-Vault aims for compatibility across Linux, macOS, and Windows (using Git Bash or WSL).

**Dependencies to Install Manually:**

You must have the following command-line tools installed and available in your system's `PATH`:

1.  **Git:** Essential for version control.
    *   **Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):** `sudo apt update && sudo apt install git`
    *   **Linux (Fedora):** `sudo dnf install git`
    *   **macOS:** `brew install git` or install with Xcode Command Line Tools.
    *   **Windows:** Install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win), which includes Git Bash.

2.  **GnuPG (gpg):** Used for encryption and decryption.
    *   **Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):** `sudo apt update && sudo apt install gnupg`
    *   **Linux (Fedora):** `sudo dnf install gnupg2`
    *   **macOS:** `brew install gnupg`
    *   **Windows (Git Bash):** Included with Git for Windows standard installer, or download from [GnuPG website](https://gnupg.org/download/).

3.  **tar:** For creating and extracting archives.
    *   Usually pre-installed on Linux and macOS.
    *   Included with Git for Windows (Git Bash).

4.  **Core Utilities (sha1sum, mktemp):** Standard Unix utilities.
    *   **Linux:** Typically pre-installed via the `coreutils` package.
    *   **macOS:** `sha1sum` might need installation (`brew install coreutils`), or use `shasum -a 1` which is usually built-in. `mktemp` is usually built-in.
    *   **Windows (Git Bash):** Included with Git for Windows (`sha1sum.exe`, `mktemp.exe`).

5.  **sed:** Stream editor for text manipulation.
    *   Usually pre-installed on Linux and macOS.
    *   Included with Git for Windows (Git Bash).

6.  **Bats-core:** The test framework.
    *   **Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):** `sudo apt update && sudo apt install bats`
    *   **Linux (Fedora):** `sudo dnf install bats`
    *   **macOS:** `brew install bats-core`
    *   **Windows (Git Bash/WSL):** Clone the repo and install manually: `git clone https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core.git && cd bats-core && ./install.sh $HOME` (This installs to `$HOME/bin`, ensure this is in your PATH).

**Vendored Dependencies (Included):**

The following Bats helper libraries are included directly in the repository under `test/test_helper/`. You do **not** need to install these separately:

*   `bats-assert`
*   `bats-file`
*   `bats-support`

**Setup Steps:**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/zackiles/git-vault.git
    cd git-vault
    ```
2.  **Install the manual dependencies** listed above for your operating system.
3.  **Verify installation:**
    *   Try running a basic command for each dependency (e.g., `git --version`, `gpg --version`, `bats --version`).
    *   Run the test suite from the project root to confirm everything is working:
        ```bash
        bats test
        ```

You should now have a complete development environment ready to work on Git-Vault.
